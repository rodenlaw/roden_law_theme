<h2>Common Causes of Personal Injury in Darien</h2>

<h3>I-95 Corridor Truck and Car Accidents</h3>
<p>Interstate 95 runs directly through McIntosh County, carrying thousands of tractor-trailers and passenger vehicles daily between Florida and the Northeast. The I-95/US-17 interchange near Darien is a known high-accident zone, particularly for rear-end collisions during sudden slowdowns and jackknife wrecks involving commercial trucks. Speed, fatigue, and distraction contribute to crashes in this rural corridor where emergency response times can be longer than in metro areas. Our attorneys pursue claims under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 51-1-6</strong> (negligence) and federal trucking regulations where applicable.</p>

<h3>Boating and Fishing Injuries</h3>
<p>Darien's identity is built around its waterways — the Altamaha River, Sapelo Sound, and the Intracoastal Waterway. Commercial shrimping, recreational fishing, and charter boat operations create risks for drowning, propeller strikes, dock injuries, and collisions. Boating injury claims in Georgia may invoke state negligence law or, for workers injured on navigable waters, federal maritime law including the Jones Act and Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA). Our firm handles both state and federal maritime injury claims.</p>

<h3>Premises Liability on US-17 Commercial Properties</h3>
<p>US-17 through Darien and nearby Brunswick serves as the primary commercial corridor for the Golden Isles. Gas stations, hotels, restaurants, and retail properties along this route see heavy tourist traffic. Poorly maintained parking lots, inadequate lighting, wet floors, and unstable walking surfaces lead to slip-and-fall injuries. Under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 51-3-1</strong>, property owners and occupiers owe a duty of ordinary care to invitees. We hold negligent property owners accountable for preventable injuries.</p>

<h2>Georgia Personal Injury Law — What You Need to Know</h2>

<h3>Statute of Limitations</h3>
<p>Georgia law gives you <strong>two years</strong> from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 9-3-33</strong>. In wrongful death cases, the same two-year deadline applies, running from the date of death. If you miss this filing deadline, the court will bar your claim regardless of how strong the evidence may be. Contact an attorney as soon as possible to preserve your rights.</p>

<h3>Comparative Fault Rule</h3>
<p>Georgia uses a <strong>modified comparative fault</strong> standard under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 51-12-33</strong>. You may recover damages as long as your share of fault is less than 50%. Your compensation is reduced proportionally by your percentage of responsibility. If you are found 50% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery entirely. Insurance adjusters commonly attempt to inflate a victim's share of fault — our attorneys counter these strategies with thorough evidence and expert analysis.</p>

<h2>Types of Compensation Available Under Georgia Law</h2>

<p>Injured victims in Georgia can pursue <strong>economic damages</strong> including medical expenses, lost income, future earning capacity, and rehabilitation costs. <strong>Non-economic damages</strong> cover pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life. In cases of gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing, punitive damages may be awarded under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 51-12-5.1</strong>, generally capped at $250,000 unless the defendant acted with specific intent to harm or while intoxicated.</p>
