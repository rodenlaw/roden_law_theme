<h2>Personal Injury Lawyers Serving Myrtle Beach, South Carolina</h2>

<p>The Grand Strand — stretching from Little River to Georgetown — is one of the most visited tourism destinations on the East Coast, attracting over 20 million visitors annually. The combination of high-volume seasonal traffic on US-17 and US-501, water sports and beach activity, crowded hotels and entertainment venues, and a transient population creates a uniquely high-risk environment for personal injuries. Roden Law's Murrells Inlet office on Bellamy Avenue serves injury victims across the entire Grand Strand and Horry County.</p>

<p>Our firm has recovered more than <strong>$250 million</strong> for injured clients, and our Grand Strand attorneys regularly appear before the <strong>Horry County Circuit Court</strong> at 1301 2nd Avenue in Conway. Whether your injury involved a traffic collision on US-17, a water sports accident, or a hotel slip-and-fall, our team applies deep knowledge of South Carolina personal injury law to pursue maximum recovery.</p>

<h2>Common Causes of Personal Injury in Myrtle Beach</h2>

<h3>Traffic Accidents on US-17, US-501, and SC-544</h3>
<p>US-17 (Kings Highway/Ocean Highway) is the primary artery of the Grand Strand, and US-501 connects Myrtle Beach to Conway and I-95. Both highways experience severe congestion during peak tourist season (May through September) and are among the most dangerous roads in Horry County. T-bone collisions at commercial intersections, rear-end crashes in tourist traffic, and DUI accidents during evening hours account for a significant share of emergency room visits. Our attorneys investigate every crash under <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-1-300</strong> and pursue claims against negligent, distracted, and impaired drivers.</p>

<h3>Water Sports and Beach Activity Injuries</h3>
<p>Jet ski rentals, parasailing, banana boat rides, and surfing are staples of the Grand Strand vacation experience — but they come with serious risk. Jet ski collisions, parasailing harness failures, and drowning incidents occur every summer season. Rental operators and tour companies have a duty to maintain equipment, train staff, and warn customers of known dangers. When they fail in that duty, victims may pursue negligence claims and, in cases of extreme recklessness, punitive damages under South Carolina law. Our firm also handles cases arising from rip current drownings and injuries at beachfront pools where adequate lifeguard supervision was lacking.</p>

<h3>Hotel, Resort, and Entertainment Venue Injuries</h3>
<p>The Grand Strand is lined with hotels, resorts, amusement parks, and entertainment complexes. Slip-and-fall injuries on wet pool decks, balcony falls from improperly maintained railings, elevator malfunctions, food poisoning, and amusement ride injuries give rise to premises liability and product liability claims. Property owners in South Carolina owe a duty of reasonable care to invitees — guests paying to stay, dine, or play on their premises. Our attorneys hold hotel chains, resort operators, and amusement venues accountable when negligent maintenance or insufficient safety measures cause injury.</p>

<h2>South Carolina Personal Injury Law — What You Need to Know</h2>

<h3>Statute of Limitations</h3>
<p>South Carolina gives you <strong>three years</strong> from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit under <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-3-530</strong>. For tourists injured while visiting the Grand Strand, it is important to understand that this deadline applies even if you return to your home state — the lawsuit must be filed in South Carolina within three years. Delay can result in lost evidence and faded witness memories, so we encourage prompt consultation.</p>

<h3>Comparative Fault Rule</h3>
<p>South Carolina uses a <strong>modified comparative fault</strong> standard. You can recover compensation as long as your percentage of fault is <strong>less than 51%</strong>. If your fault reaches 51% or more, you recover nothing. Awards are reduced by your share of responsibility. In Grand Strand cases — particularly water sports and beach activity claims — defendants frequently argue that the victim assumed the risk or was contributorily negligent. Our attorneys anticipate these defenses and build evidence showing the operator's or property owner's primary negligence.</p>

<h2>Types of Compensation Available Under South Carolina Law</h2>

<p>Grand Strand injury victims can recover <strong>economic damages</strong> including all medical expenses (emergency, surgical, rehabilitative), lost wages, diminished future earning capacity, and travel costs incurred for treatment. <strong>Non-economic damages</strong> compensate for pain and suffering, mental anguish, scarring and disfigurement, and loss of enjoyment of life — particularly relevant for visitors whose vacations were destroyed by preventable injuries. In cases involving willful, wanton, or reckless conduct, <strong>punitive damages</strong> may be awarded under <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-32-520</strong>, generally capped at the greater of three times compensatory damages or $500,000.</p>
