<h2>Common Causes of Personal Injury in Charleston</h2>

<h3>Car Accidents on I-26 and the Ravenel Bridge</h3>
<p>The I-26 corridor into downtown Charleston carries heavy commuter and commercial traffic, and the Ravenel Bridge connecting Charleston to Mount Pleasant sees over 70,000 vehicles daily. High-speed rear-end collisions, lane-change sideswipes, and multi-vehicle pileups are frequent on these routes. Distracted driving and DUI contribute to the crash rate, particularly on weekend evenings. Our attorneys pursue negligence claims under <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-1-300</strong> and work with accident reconstruction professionals to establish liability.</p>

<h3>Slip-and-Fall Injuries Downtown and on King Street</h3>
<p>Charleston's vibrant retail, restaurant, and hospitality districts — concentrated along King Street, Market Street, and East Bay Street — attract millions of visitors annually. Uneven sidewalks, wet restaurant floors, poor staircase maintenance, and construction debris create hazardous conditions. Under South Carolina premises liability law, property owners and operators must exercise reasonable care to keep their premises safe for invitees. We hold negligent businesses accountable for injuries caused by foreseeable hazards.</p>

<h3>Port of Charleston and Industrial Injuries</h3>
<p>The Port of Charleston is a major East Coast shipping hub, and the Boeing assembly plant in North Charleston employs thousands. Dock workers, warehouse employees, and manufacturing workers face risks including forklift accidents, crush injuries, falls from height, and repetitive stress injuries. Depending on the circumstances, injured workers may have claims under South Carolina workers' compensation law, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, or the Jones Act. Our firm evaluates each case to identify all available avenues of recovery.</p>

<h2>South Carolina Personal Injury Law — What You Need to Know</h2>

<h3>Statute of Limitations</h3>
<p>Under <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-3-530</strong>, you have <strong>three years</strong> from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit in South Carolina. While three years may seem like ample time, evidence deteriorates, witnesses become harder to locate, and insurance companies benefit from delay. We recommend consulting an attorney as soon as possible after an injury to protect your claim.</p>

<h3>Comparative Fault Rule</h3>
<p>South Carolina follows a <strong>modified comparative fault</strong> system. You can recover damages only if your share of fault is <strong>less than 51%</strong>. If you are found 51% or more at fault, you are barred from recovery. If your fault is 50% or below, your award is reduced by your percentage of responsibility. Defense attorneys and insurance adjusters in Charleston aggressively argue comparative fault to minimize payouts — our team pushes back with facts and evidence.</p>

In cases involving reckless, willful, or wanton conduct, South Carolina law allows <strong>punitive damages</strong> under <strong>S.C.
