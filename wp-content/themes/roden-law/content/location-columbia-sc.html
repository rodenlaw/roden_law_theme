<h2>Personal Injury Lawyers Serving Columbia, South Carolina</h2>

<p>Columbia is South Carolina's capital city and sits at the junction of three major interstates — I-26, I-77, and I-20 — making it one of the busiest traffic corridors in the state. Home to Fort Jackson, the University of South Carolina, and a growing healthcare and government employment base, Columbia sees a high volume of motor vehicle accidents, workplace injuries, and premises liability incidents. Roden Law's Columbia office at 1545 Sumter Street provides personal injury representation to clients throughout Richland County, Lexington County, and the Midlands region.</p>

<p>Our firm has recovered more than <strong>$250 million</strong> for clients across South Carolina and Georgia. Our Columbia attorneys regularly appear before the <strong>Richland County Circuit Court</strong> at 1701 Main Street and are well versed in the local courts, judges, and procedural requirements that affect how personal injury cases move through the South Carolina legal system.</p>

<h2>Common Causes of Personal Injury in Columbia</h2>

<h3>Interstate Highway Accidents at the I-26/I-77/I-20 Interchange</h3>
<p>Columbia's three-interstate junction is one of the most congested and crash-prone corridors in South Carolina. The I-26/I-20 interchange on the west side of the city and the I-77/I-20 split to the north see frequent multi-vehicle accidents, especially during rush hour and inclement weather. Tractor-trailers traveling between Charlotte, Charleston, and Greenville pass through Columbia daily, contributing to severe truck accident injuries. Our attorneys pursue negligence claims under <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-1-300</strong> and investigate whether federal trucking regulations (Hours of Service, vehicle maintenance) were violated.</p>

<h3>Fort Jackson and Military Base Traffic Injuries</h3>
<p>Fort Jackson is the U.S. Army's largest Initial Entry Training installation, bringing tens of thousands of soldiers, civilian employees, and visitors to the Columbia area each year. The heavy traffic around Gate 2 on Forest Drive and Gate 5 on Percival Road, combined with unfamiliar drivers navigating an unfamiliar city, leads to elevated accident rates on roads surrounding the base. Our attorneys represent both civilian and military-connected individuals injured in off-base traffic accidents under South Carolina state law.</p>

<h3>Medical Malpractice at Area Hospitals</h3>
<p>Columbia is a regional healthcare hub with major facilities including Prisma Health Richland, Providence Health, and Lexington Medical Center. While these institutions provide life-saving care, medical errors — including surgical mistakes, misdiagnosis, medication errors, and emergency room failures — do occur. South Carolina medical malpractice claims must comply with the pre-suit mediation requirements of <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-79-125</strong> and are subject to specific damage caps. Our attorneys work with medical experts to evaluate and prosecute complex medical negligence cases.</p>

<h2>South Carolina Personal Injury Law — What You Need to Know</h2>

<h3>Statute of Limitations</h3>
<p>Under <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-3-530</strong>, personal injury lawsuits in South Carolina must be filed within <strong>three years</strong> of the date of injury. For medical malpractice cases, a three-year statute applies from the date of the act or omission, with a six-year statute of repose under <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-3-545</strong>. Missing the filing deadline permanently bars your claim, so early consultation with an attorney is critical.</p>

<h3>Comparative Fault Rule</h3>
<p>South Carolina applies a <strong>modified comparative fault</strong> rule. You may recover damages if you bear <strong>less than 51% of the fault</strong> for your injury. If your share reaches 51% or higher, you are completely barred from compensation. When your fault is 50% or below, your damages are reduced proportionally. Defense attorneys in Richland County routinely argue comparative fault to deflect liability — our team anticipates and counters these strategies with detailed evidence and expert testimony.</p>

<h2>Types of Compensation Available Under South Carolina Law</h2>

<p>Columbia injury victims may pursue <strong>economic damages</strong> — including medical expenses (past and future), lost wages, diminished earning capacity, and out-of-pocket costs — as well as <strong>non-economic damages</strong> for pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and scarring or disfigurement. Where the defendant's conduct was reckless, willful, or wanton, South Carolina law permits <strong>punitive damages</strong> under <strong>S.C. Code &#167; 15-32-520</strong>, typically capped at the greater of three times compensatory damages or $500,000.</p>
