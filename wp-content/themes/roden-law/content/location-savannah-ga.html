<h2>Common Causes of Personal Injury in Savannah</h2>

<h3>Car and Truck Accidents on I-16 and I-95</h3>
<p>Savannah sits at the convergence of two major interstate highways. I-16 funnels traffic from Atlanta into the metro area, while I-95 carries heavy north-south commercial truck traffic along the Eastern Seaboard. The interchange between I-16 and I-95 west of Savannah is one of the highest-accident corridors in Georgia. Rear-end collisions, sideswipes during lane merges, and catastrophic semi-truck wrecks are common on these stretches. Our attorneys handle motor vehicle accident claims under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 51-1-6</strong> (negligence) and work with accident reconstruction experts to build strong cases.</p>

<h3>Slip-and-Fall Injuries in the Historic District</h3>
<p>Savannah's Historic District draws millions of tourists each year. Uneven cobblestone streets, aging sidewalks, wet restaurant floors, and poorly maintained commercial properties contribute to a high rate of slip-and-fall injuries. Property owners and managers in Georgia have a duty of care to maintain safe premises under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 51-3-1</strong>. We hold negligent property owners accountable for injuries caused by hazardous conditions.</p>

<h3>Maritime and Port Injuries</h3>
<p>The Port of Savannah is the fourth-busiest container port in the United States, employing thousands of longshoremen, crane operators, and dock workers. Injuries at the port may involve federal maritime law, including the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) or the Jones Act for seamen. Our attorneys understand the interplay between federal maritime jurisdiction and Georgia state law and represent injured port workers seeking full recovery.</p>

<h2>Georgia Personal Injury Law — What You Need to Know</h2>

<h3>Statute of Limitations</h3>
<p>Under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 9-3-33</strong>, you have <strong>two years</strong> from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit in Georgia. Missing this deadline means the court will almost certainly dismiss your case, regardless of its merits. For wrongful death claims, the two-year clock starts from the date of death under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 9-3-33</strong>.</p>

<h3>Comparative Fault Rule</h3>
<p>Georgia follows a <strong>modified comparative fault</strong> system under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 51-12-33</strong>. You can recover damages only if you are less than 50% at fault for the accident. If you are found 50% or more responsible, you recover nothing. If you are found partially at fault but under the 50% threshold, your award is reduced by your percentage of fault. Insurance companies routinely try to shift blame onto injured victims to reduce payouts — our attorneys challenge these tactics aggressively.</p>

<h2>Types of Compensation Available Under Georgia Law</h2>

<p>Georgia personal injury victims may recover both <strong>economic damages</strong> (medical bills, lost wages, future earning capacity, rehabilitation costs) and <strong>non-economic damages</strong> (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life). In cases involving willful misconduct, wantonness, or fraud, punitive damages may be available under <strong>O.C.G.A. &#167; 51-12-5.1</strong>. Georgia caps most punitive damage awards at $250,000 unless the defendant acted with specific intent to cause harm or was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</p>
